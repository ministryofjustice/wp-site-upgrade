# Site Update Management Utility
[logo]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/wp-site-upgrade/raw/master/sumu-small.png "SUMU Logo"
This utility provides a collection of bash scripts that can be used for a variety of task such as; applying software updates to dependencies defined in the `composer.json` and `package.json` files, typically located in a bedrock structured website. It also contains helper commands to simplify development.

**Install this repo by following the guidance a little further down the page.**

In order to execute the utility correctly please make sure the structure of your local siteâ€™s directory follows the [Mac Bootstrap](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/wp-mac-bootstrap) configuration.

## Installation

1. Add this GitHub repository as a package source for your global composer install:
   
   ```bash
   composer global config repositories.sumu vcs https://github.com/ministryofjustice/wp-site-upgrade
   ```
2. Install `site-upgrade` and `site-upgrade-run` from the `master` branch:
   
   ```bash
   composer global require ministryofjustice/wp-site-upgrade:dev-master
   ```

3. You should now be able to run `site-upgrade` from any sites/directory or, `site-upgrade-run` from anywhere on your computer.

**Note:** If you see an error `site-upgrade: command not found`, it'll likely be because you don't have the composer bin directory in your PATH. Refer to the [composer requirements](#composer) section of this document.

## Commands

#### `site-upgrade`
- Run this command from anywhere
- It requires one argument; the path to the sites' directory
  - Pass `.` (dot) from within the directory itself
  - `all` is an alias, use this from anywhere to invoke `site-upgrade-run`
- Generally used to upgrade a single site

There are 5 steps in the upgrade process:

1. Handling composer packages
2. Handling node dependencies
3. Launching Docker for review
4. Submitting pull requests via GitHub
5. Cleanup; always occurs, even if there is an error

Each step provides just enough output to ensure successful updates.

Execute `site-upgrade .` from a site directory (requires `wp-mac-bootstrap` directory formation) - the command currently requires one argument which is the path to the root directory of a website.

You can find a bulk command in this package named `site-upgrade-run` (details below). If you execute this command it will cycle through your `sites` directory picking up those with a docker-compose.yml file inside. 


#### `site-upgrade-run`
- Run this command from anywhere on your computer
- Takes zero arguments
- Great for updating all sites

## Helpers

#### `site-image-regen`
Useful while developing a base image such as:

- https://github.com/ministryofjustice/wp-multisite-base-docker
- https://github.com/ministryofjustice/wordpress-base-docker

This command will re-build a base image associated with a website. It will do it locally using `docker build` and then re-build the site.

- Run this command from the root of a website - not the base-docker image itself
- Takes zero arguments
- Automated base repo detection built in

#### Please watch out for...
The auto detect feature of `site-image-regen` expects uniquely named base repositories on your system. If you have the same repo (by name) located in different directories the command may fail. For instance, consider these 2 *hypothetical* directory locations for `wordpress-base-docker`.

- `~/utils/wordpress-base-docker`
- `~/utils-dev/wordpress-base-docker`

This example will produce a failure causing the command to exit.

**Could we mitigate this issue?**

Making an exception for this type of issue was not possible at the time of writing because we cannot determine if the first or second result is the repo we need to rebuild.

A possible solution is to feedback multiple results in the UI and ask the user to confirm which one. Of course, another solution is to make sure we have one source of truth on our systems.  


## Requirements
Please ensure the directory structure matches the default layout detailed in `wp-mac-bootstrap`

With process automation comes a level of software dependancy. This script requires the following software to operate:

- npm-update (auto install at runtime available)
- Docker
- Dory proxy (`gem install dory`)

### Composer

Composer should be accessible globally with the command `composer`.

Composer's global bin directory `~/.composer/vendor/bin/` should be added to your PATH so that binaries provided by installed packages can be run from your terminal. [Instructions available here.](https://akrabat.com/global-installation-of-php-tools-with-composer/)
